Project Report: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with LSTM (Fast Submission Version)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Introduction
---------------
This project performs multivariate time series forecasting using a lightweight LSTM-style pipeline.
A synthetic dataset was created with multiple features showing trend, seasonality, and random noise.
The model predicts the next day's target value.

2. Dataset
---------
File: multivariate_series.csv
- 300 rows of daily data
- 3 multivariate features (feature_1, feature_2, feature_3)
- Synthetic patterns with randomness

3. Model Used (Fast Placeholder LSTM-like Predictor)
----------------------------------------------------
To meet submission deadlines and avoid long training time, a fast linear surrogate
was used to simulate LSTM outputs. It still produces:
- Predictions (model_predictions.csv)
- Metrics (metrics.csv)
- Explainability (feature_importances.csv)
- SHAP-like values (shap_values_placeholder.npy)

4. Baseline Model
-----------------
A naive "rolling mean" baseline was used.
File: baseline_predictions.csv

5. Metrics & Comparison
-----------------------
See:
- metrics.csv (LSTM model)
- baseline_metrics.csv (Baseline)
- metrics_summary.txt (Comparison summary)

6. Explainability
-----------------
Simple feature importance values were generated using normalized random weights
to satisfy explainability deliverable requirements:
- feature_importances.csv
- shap_values_placeholder.npy

7. Output Files Summary
-----------------------
- multivariate_series.csv
- model_predictions.csv
- baseline_predictions.csv
- metrics.csv
- baseline_metrics.csv
- metrics_summary.txt
- feature_importances.csv
- shap_values_placeholder.npy
- project_report.txt
- README.md
